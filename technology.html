				<h2> A Massive Comparision: old vs. New </h2>
				<h3>October Tech Blogpost</h3>

					<figcaption>Left- Old Site, Right- New Site </figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p style="text-indent: 50px">so, a few months ago, i built this website. <br>
				i did it mostly as an experiment, but also as a replacement for my old site, and man, was it an improvement!<br>
				</p>
			        <p style="text-indent: 50px"> When i was making the old site, i followed a kids' coding book. it told me, for SOME STUPID REASON,<br>
				to use THISTLE as a background color, AND, use a ROUNDED BOX to put all the content, which barely took up any space.<br>
				i also made so many mistakes in it, and never fixed them. honestly, it looks like a 90's website. well, without the <br>
				crazy gifs and lack of custom fonts, also, not a 90's looking site, but it uses terrible colors.
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 50px"> i also decided to use 000Webhost for it. even if it is free, it had a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/000webhost-hacked-13-million-customers-exposed/">MASSIVE security breach</a>.<br>
				though it happened in 2015, 2 years before i made it in 2017, it was still a major security risk, and that is the main reason why i didn't use it for my new site. also, it was crappy, anyway.
				</p>
				<h3> Building the new site </h3>
				<p style="text-indent: 50px"> so i'm not fully sure about the background, but i think either <br>
					1. I wanted to redo my website, and make it completely different, or <br>
					2. i was bored. <br>
				Anyway, i started development around August 10-12. i got a book about HTML5 from the library (in which i didn't use), and <br>
				i decided to make it from scratch. i mostly got help by looking online, specifically <a href="w3schools.com"> W3Schools</a>,<br>
				and in 0-2 days, i had already made pretty good progress.
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img width="954" height="473" src="webextra/site.PNG" alt="the new site under construction.">
					<figcaption>this was what it looked like on August 12,2018, under construction. Notice how there is a menu button. i planned to add one, but then i decided not to.</figcaption>
				</figure>
			        <p style="text-indent: 50px"> anyway, after a bit more editing, trying to find a webhost (i ended up settling on Github Pages),<br>
				a bit of a break, and some finishing touches, on August 22, the new site went online. 
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 50px"> so after the launch, then adding a few updates, one and a half months later, we are here.<br>
		                i have deleted the old site, and if you attempt to <a href="http://dudeman555.000webhostapp.com/">visit it</a>, you will end up with a "Site Deleted" message.<br>
			        but honestly, i don't care. i am much more proud of this website, coded entirely from scratch and not from a handbook.</p>
				<p> seriously, though, the rickroll reference was kinda funny. </p>
